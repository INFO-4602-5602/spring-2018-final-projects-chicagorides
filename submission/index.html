		<p class="info">Indian Premier League(IPL) is a league of teams owned by celebrities and business tycoons in India. This league convenes once every year to play a season for the span of 3 months. The interesting part about this is that we have cricket players from all over the world shuffled into different league teams. There are 9 teams in the league. They are all paired to play against each other and the best four teams go into the playoffs to win the IPL trophy.<br /><br />
		This league has been around for 10 years and every year and each year there are a total of 70 matches played. We are interested in analyzing this data associated to learn how the teams and the players perform. We visualized the number of games played by each team against other teams, the trend of fours and sixes over the 20 overs, and which batsman and bowler performed the best.</p></div>
